# Space Missions Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of space missions from 1957 to August 2022. It includes data on the location, date, and result of each launch, as well as the company responsible, and details about the rockets used. The Power BI dashboard visualizes the historical trends of space exploration and provides insights into mission success rates, rocket usage, and launch locations.

## Data Description
The dataset includes:
- **Mission Details**: Date, location, company responsible, and mission result.
- **Rocket Information**: Rocket name, price, status (active or retired).
- **Countries**: Countries associated with each space mission.

## Analysis & insights
### 1. Trends in Rocket Launches
- **Launch Frequency Over Time:** Analyze how rocket launches have evolved from 1957 to 2022.
- **Success Rates:** Examine the trend in the success rate of space missions over time and determine whether it has improved.
### 2. Country Performance
- **Top Countries in Space Missions:** Identify which countries have launched the most successful space missions.
- **Historical Comparison:** Analyze if the leading countries in space exploration today have always dominated the space industry or if other countries have played significant roles at different times.
### 3. Rocket Analysis
- **Most Used Rockets:** Determine which rockets have been used most frequently in space missions.
- **Rocket Status:** Check whether the most-used rockets are still in service or if they have been retired.
### 4. Launch Location Patterns
- **Launch Sites:** Explore patterns and trends related to launch locations. Are certain locations used more frequently for specific types of missions or companies?
- **Country-Specific Launch Sites:** Analyze which countries prefer particular launch sites and whether there are geographic trends in launch frequencies.
